# GES_772

This repository is for my classwork and homework in GES 772\
Leafet 1 - 4 are for classwork 4\
Leafet 4 is the working version for the last question in Classwork 4\
Homework4.geojson and map.geojson are the geoJSON files that I used in Classwork 4\
Homework5_Q1 is the html file for the first question for Home work 5.  The criteria was:\
  Three countries in Europe and three in America\
  Countries in Europe colored in blue\
  Countries in America colored in red\
  Popups including both name and population of the country\
The HTML file gets its data from sixcountries.geojson and pulls from the version of the geoJSON file in my github account\
